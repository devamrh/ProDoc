## Next JS isn't working ?

Solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77232531/run-of-a-next-js-app-stuck-npm-run-dev-doesnt-work



## NextJS is rendering but not showing the components?

Solution: 
1. Add console.log to each components
2. Check the imports in layout.tsx and page.tsx
3. Crosscheck everything and check if they are working using the browser inspect
4. If they are not working try to re-render by stoping the current render and re-run "npm run dev"
